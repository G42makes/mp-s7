Next Steps:
1. ~~Generate headers from cmake file instead of compiling the example~~
2. Get the code reading files from filesystem
3. Open and execute a fiel from the OS
4. Build/Find a good test.py file to verify features as they are added.

Items that I should do/would be nice to have.

- See if using the Retro68 Console readline would be a better option, see the linux port for examples on how to override.
- Allow opening of files to run from a menu
- Peripheral Support(ie serial)
- Network Support(have to get networking running in my emulator first, my hardware is offline)

Fantasy category, for now:
- Add an editor.
- support FrameBuffer module
