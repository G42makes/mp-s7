Items that I should do/would be nice to have.

- See if using the Retro68 Console readline would be a better option, see the linux port for examples on how to override.
- Allow opening of files to run from a menu
- Peripheral Support(ie serial)
- Network Support(have to get networking running in my emulator first, my hardware is offline)

Fantasy category, for now:
- Add an editor.
